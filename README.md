# OU_PINN_Drift_and_Diffusion_Estimation
This repository uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate the probability density function, drift, and diffusion of univariate and bivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. It combines deep learning with physics constraints to model stochastic dynamics.
